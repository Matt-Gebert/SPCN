G’day,
At St Paul’s we believe that relationships and a sense of belonging make life more meaningful. We also believe that Jesus gives us a way to live in connection to God.  Jesus taught and modelled a spirituality that works, and makes sense of life in Australia in the 21st century. 
Whether you’re investigating the claims of Jesus or looking for a place to connect with others  you are welcome at our church. We are a diverse and growing community with a wide range of ages, ethnic backgrounds and interests.
Please look around our web site to get a sense of who we are. If you want to know more or have any questions feel free to contact us. We’d love to hear from you.

God bless you.
Howard
